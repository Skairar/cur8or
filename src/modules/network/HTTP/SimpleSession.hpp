/**
 * @brief Simple, lightweight HTTP session
 * 
 * Objects of this class provide the basic functionality in terms of
 * receiving requests and sending responses, with callback passed on
 * creation serving as a customization point.
 * 
 * I works in a callback loop, with startSession function serving as a
 * starting point. The general cycle looks as follows:
 * 
 * startSession()
 *       async call
 *      V
 * readStream() ---> procesRequest() --> loader_(request, callback)
 *      É…     async call                           .
 *      |                                          . processing request, might
 *      | keep_alive=true                          . be happening in completely
 *      |                                          . different thread and module
 *      |                                          .
 * responseStatus() <--- sendResponse() <-- callback(response)
 *      |         async call
 *      | keep_alive=false || error
 *      V
 *  endSession()
 * 
 * The callback passed at creation, represented here as loader_, is a higher
 * order function that aside of requests receives another callable object
 * as it's argument, giving loader_ a complete freedom when it comes to 
 * processing request as long as it invokes back the callback with response
 * when it's finished. SimpleSession binds its own shared_pointer to the
 * response callback, so the caller can rest assured that the session object
 * will still be in memory when called back.
 * 
 * TODO: Error logging
 *
